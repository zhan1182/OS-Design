Q1. one-level:
	1. Build the OS
	  cd one-level;
	  cd os;
	  make;
	2. Use the test cases written for question 2 to test
	  cd ../apps/examples;
	  make
	  make run 

Q2. test program:
    The same program is in two places for testing one-level paging and two-level paging. 1. one-level/apps/example/ 2.two-level/apps/example/
    The program will do the following sequentially:
    	1. Print "Hello World"
	2. Allocate a static array larger than 4KB
	3. User recursion to create 10000 call stacks
	4. Call "Hello World" program 100 times
	5. Create 30 simultaneous processes. Each of them count 0 to 1000000. This step needs about 10 seconds to run.
	6. Access memory beyond the maximum virtual address. This step will create an error


Q3. two-level:
    	1. Build the OS
	  cd two-level;
	  cd os;
	  make;
	2. Use the test cases written for question 2 to test
	  cd ../apps/examples;
	  make
	  make run
